Project organization. We'll be using a **loose** form of Scrum over the summer [Scrum Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TycLR0TqFA&ab_channel=Uzility). Basically we'll do 1 week chunks of work and keep track of what we are doing on a shared project board. Once a day we'll do a quick 5min check in (on the discussion thread) between 9-10am and then on our weekly meetings, we will demo what we did over the week.

Sprint 1: June 13-24. Summer project background reading and working on tutorials. https://github.com/UW-Upwelling-Project/Summer-2022/projects/1
Sprint 2: June 27-July 8. Try coding first idea
